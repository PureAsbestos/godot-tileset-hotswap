# Godot Tileset Hotswap
A shader-based approach to hotswapping tileset graphics in Godot, [created for Chucklepie](https://twitter.com/PureAsbestos/status/1491446171403169792)'s [Rex Remake](https://chucklepie.itch.io/rex-remake).
It maps graphics from a 256x256 atlas onto tiles that have their graphics pulled from a 256x256 red/green texture, using a post-processing shader.
